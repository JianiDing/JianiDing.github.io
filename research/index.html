		I am an observer interested in the extragalactic astronomy.
		Currently I am working on projects about
		the environment of quasars and their host galaxies.

		Quasars are very luminous objects in the deep universe.
		They are supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the center of distant galaxies
		that are actively accreting materials, releasing huge amounts of energy.
		I am trying to provide clues to the following open questions:
		(1) how quasars form, and
		(2) how quasars influence their host galaxies.
		Currently I am conducting two research projects in this topic:

	<p style="font-family:lato light;color:white">
		(1) Quasar host galaxies at low redshift.
	</p>
	<p style="font-family:lato light;color:white">
		(2) Close companions of quasars.
