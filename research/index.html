		I am an observer interested in the extragalactic astronomy.
		Currently I am working on projects about
		the environment of quasars and their host galaxies.

		Quasars are very luminous objects in the deep universe.
		They are supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the center of distant galaxies.
		I am trying to provide clues to the following open questions:
		(1) how are quasars formed, and
		(2) how do quasars influence their host galaxies.
		I use PSF-subtraction technique to reveal the host galaxies and
		close companions of quasars.
