		Currently, my main research includes working on intergalactic medium (IGM) with machine learning technique through large data sets, such as Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) 
		data. I am also working on studying the Lyman alpha emission around quasars through PDLA systems. The two projects are as follows. 
		
	<p style="font-family:lato light;color:white">
		(1) Measuring the effective optical depth of Lyman series through a sample of quasars in EBOSS DR14.
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-family:lato light;color:white">
		(2) Studying the quasar host galaxy through an associate DLA system.
		This project focuses on using DLA as an coronagraph to block the central quasar nuclei in order to reveal the 
		narrow extended Lyman alpha emission around quasars. We combine the medium resolution spectra and the HST high resolution imaging to study this extended Lyman alpha 
		emission around quasars (showed in the figure below)
